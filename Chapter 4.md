# Chapter 4

There were stone guards at the city gates and on the road.

In the last day or two Miranda had learnt to fear them. As a child she had been encouraged to go to them for help. And the one time she had gotten lost, they had taken one look at her topaz clasp, and immediately helped her home. 

She wasn’t wearing her clasp now, or her blue velvet cloak. She had found the least obtrusive clothes she could, and her success showed in the disdain the guards eyed her with.

She was headed North. She had never been outside of Stonehaven before. In fact, aside from her search for the sunstone, there were huge parts of Stonehaven that she had never visited either. She now suspected that the people there weren't particularly dangerous- rather they had magic that was disapproved of.

As Miranda walked she watched others on the road. Men with carts of produce coming in. a cart half filled with ceramic pots leaving. There were people travelling with purpose and surety. And wanderers with worn out shoes; slow walkers that seemed to be heading nowhere in particular. There was a thin woman walking with a bundle of kids. The baby held in a sling began to cry. A young child laughed and tried to step on the boots of his elder sister in front. An older boy led a donkey loaded with bags.

And of course, she watched the soldiers. They stood at points along the roadway, always in threes. 

She felt like they were watching her. They were watching everyone. Faces hard, not chatting, even to each other. Her cloak would make her stand out from the crowd on a warm day, but she wished she had her hood to hide within.

She hitched up the pack slung over her back, and continued walking. Her slippers weren't made for this- they slipped slightly with each step she took, the leather flapping lightly against her soles. 

The road was long, stretching as far as she could see. There are a few trees here and there, struggling to grow on the plains. She couldn’t see anything that looked like the forest she needed to pass through on the way to Fire country..

“You there!” 

Miranda froze, shrinking into herself as though the soldier might divert his attention elsewhere.

“Halt!” 

But she wasn’t moving. She kept her head down, straining to see around her, without moving anything but her eyes.

Everyone on the road seemed frozen. Everyone had their heads down. Children were being held tightly, and shushed in whispers. The woman from earlier had her hand over her squirming baby’s mouth. The laughing boy clung tightly to her skirt. She looked as frightened as Miranda felt.

“Hey, don’t!” The voice was a man’s. “Leave her alo-!” The voice cut off with a grunt.

Miranda didn’t hear a woman’s voice. 

“Move along. Nothing to see here.” A new voice.

She didn’t turn around to look. She didn’t want to know, and didn’t want to give any excuse for them to focus on her. Instead she waited to move until she saw others on the road begin to hurry away. And then she followed, as quickly as she could, slippers still flapping softly against her feet. 

The travellers moved together, hurrying onwards without looking back. No one spoke. Finally  the woman took her hand from her baby’s mouth. They were screaming nearly silently, face red and tears dripping. 

The boy hadn’t spoken since the soldiers called out. The woman gently unlatched his hand and squeezed it. Then she loosened her blouse and pressed the babe’s mouth to her breast. She doesn’t stop walking and she doesn’t look back. The stress lines don’t leave her face, but the children relax and begin to chat.

Miranda felt sick, her stomach roiled, rebelling. She stumbled to the side of the road and retched,  losing the bread and meat she had eaten that morning. She wiped her mouth with the back of her hand, and someone passed her a water bottle. 

It was the oldest boy in the family– the one leading the donkey. “It’s easier if you don’t look back,” He said.

Miranda swished a careful sip of water around her mouth and spat it out. It pooled on the rocky edge, slipping down the hill. The ground was baked dry, too dry for the water to sink into the earth that badly needed it.

She passed back the water bottle. “Does that happen often?”

He slung the water bag back over his shoulder, then gestured with his free hand for her to speed up. “Where are you headed?”

Miranda frowned at the way he avoided answering her question. But he had been kind, offering the water bag. And she was already feeling the pinch of loneliness. “I’m going to the volcano.”

Something eased in his face. “It happens enough that it’s not a shock.” His gaze focused on his family ahead. “We all have to be careful.” 

Miranda studied his face. “What do you do to be careful?”

His face pinched again, eyes wary. “It’s not safe to travel alone. Who are you with?” He looked around, almost as though looking for her companions.

Miranda looked around too, buying a minute, while she decided what to say. It was all too clear that she had been sheltered her whole life. She was out, and unprepared to be. But she was also privileged, and still safe in a way that this boy had never been. “My Mum is sick.” She hesitated, not sure how much to share.

“She’s not well enough to travel? I’m sorry.” He looked towards his own family again. They had nearly reached them. “We’re headed to the Forest. You can camp with us til then if you want.” The words were careless, but the boy’s shoulders were tense. He was taking a chance.

Miranda nodded slowly. Besides packing a camp roll, she hadn’t thought about how safe she should keep safe sleeping on the road. She looked at the mother, the sister, the child and the baby. “Thank you.”

He nodded. “We’re heading to the forest. If your mother is sick, you might be better off stopping there.”

“Johnny!” His Mum looked Miranda over suspiciously. “Who’s this then?”

The baby was back in the sling. It was silent, watching with big eyes as it chewed solemnly on it’s fist. 

“I’m Miranda.” She pulled her eyes away from the baby to look at his mother.

The boy, Johnny, rolled his eyes and added. “She’s headed to Mt Fire. Her Mum’s sick so she’s travelling alone.”

The mother frowned, rubbing at a patch of embroidery on her cuff. She glanced at her own children, and sighed. “Alright.” She didn’t smile at Miranda.

They walked on in silence. When the youngest boy got tired, Johnny lifted him onto the back of the donkey, and they trudged on. As the sun began to peak, the heat of the day beat down on them from above, and reflected back on them from the road. Her slippers still flapped, and she imagined she could feel the heat of the rocks below her feet. 

Every now and then someone would shout from behind them, and the road walkers would move aside for a horse and rider, or a carriage shining with stone. Each time they moved aside, the walkers would tense, and the fear would return to their eyes. Miranda didn’t know what they feared. But she didn’t ask, just silently moved aside with them.

Slowly the land began to change. Amongst the rocks, and scrub, there were large tree stumps. As though the wood had been cut and taken for building. Miranda’s stomach rumbled, but while the family had passed their water bags around a few times, none of them had mentioned food. Miranda had some provisions in her pack, but didn’t want to ask for a rest when she was one of the oldest, and a stranger at that.

Eventually they reached a fork in the road. In between the two offshoots was a small stone hut. On either side of it was a small sapling. There were a few small trees and shrubs scattering the plains now, but these stood out for some reason. The leaves were a sharper green, or perhaps it was just chance symmetry with the hut. The family stopped, and began to unload sleeping rolls from the donkey. The sister headed silently to the hut, and passed something to the old woman that came out to meet her.

Miranda tentatively put her pack down beside the others. She sighed with relief, as she felt a breeze against the damp patch on her back. She stood taller, without the weight of her pack. She took out her sleeping roll and laid it near, but not too near the family. She grabbed her waterskin and headed for the spring to refill it. She splashed water against her face, washing the tight feeling of dried sweat off her brow.

She lowered her waterskin into the pool below the spring to fill. As the cool of the water began to bite into her hand, she saw an old cart pull up. This seemed a popular spot to stop and camp. The man headed to the stone hut, just like the daughter did, and handed something to the woman there. 

Miranda headed back to her pack and bedroll. She hesitantly pulled out her knapsack. And looked to where the family was sitting. They were eating wrinkled apples, and the mother was cutting careful slices off a small block of cheese. She looked again at her knapsack. She had raided the pantry at home, and had a small bag filled with nuts, seeds and dried fruit. She had two plump apples, flatbreads and a rather sweaty lump of cheese. She didn’t know how far it was to the volcano. 

She pulled out the sweating cheese, and one apple, and headed to where the family was sitting. She quickly placed the cheese onto the board the mother was using, and she took a bite of her apple, feeling embarrassed by the glossy skin. 

“We don’t need it,” Johnny shook his head proudly. “We’ll reach the forest tomorrow.”

His mother eyed her sons’ thin wrists, and sliced the cheese along with their own. She said nothing, but her eyes flicked back to Miranda often. Once the cheese was shared out she sat near the fire, and rubbed again at her sleeve. 

“You said your mother is sick.” It was the first time that she had spoken directly to Miranda.

Miranda nodded, mouth full of apple.

The woman’s shrewd eyes flicked to the apple, and then to the sleeves of Miranda’s tunic. “Which way will you go tomorrow?” The woman pointed toward the road’s fork.

“I’m going to the volcano.”

“Both roads go to the volcano.”

Miranda stared at the woman, feeling helpless. She had no plan beyond heading North, and finding a sunstone.

“You’re not serious Mum!” Johnny looked up from where he was talking softly with his sister. The young boy was asleep against his side. “She’s not going through the centre!”

Johnny looked at Miranda’s face. “You’re not are you? That’s… that’s crazy.” He looked back to his Mother for help, but she said nothing, just stared steadily at Miranda.

“I- I don’t know.” Miranda blinked hard. Her whole body was exhausted. “I- the. Which way is quicker?”

The woman nodded, as though confirming something to herself. “The centre is a desert, empty of water, plants and stone. Even the wind is wild there. It’s a shorter road, but more dangerous.” Her eyes reflected firelight. There was something more here than what her words said. “We will take the forest road.”

Miranda nodded helplessly, and the woman turned to her children. “Take your brother to bed Johnny. We have an early morning tomorrow.”

She rose, dusting off the cutting board, and rewrapping the knife. Before she too turned to her sleeping roll, she turned once more to Miranda. “I can’t promise any help in the forest,” she said softly. “But I can give you a floor to sleep on.”

And then Miranda was left alone. She climbed into her bed, and lay staring into the dying embers of the fire.Her whole world had changed. She reached her magic down into the stone beneath her mat. It felt the same as always, and she slowly drifted off to sleep.
