# Chapter One

Miranda took a deep breath and lowered the hood of her cloak. The biting wind tore at her hair and her hem, but it also gave her an excuse for her red rimmed eyes. The shop she stood outside was her last hope. It had a narrow, slightly uneven door. The paint was cracked, and the colour was indistinguishable from the timber beneath.

She’d begun the morning in large, airy establishments, moving with purpose. After all, she was trying to fool the shopkeepers into believing that she had a right to be there. She’d ostentatiously jangled her bag of coins and announced herself an apprentice doing guild research. It had worked, to an extent. The shopkeepers had fallen over themselves to help, but no-one had offered her what she needed. There were significant glances between staff as they offered her a gleaming rose quartz. A matronly woman had firmly pulled her young assistant  away from the locked store cupboards and told Miranda to try jade instead.

Finally, when her voice had risen, and her eyes filled with tears they had brought out a few chips of sunstone. But to cure her mother she needed a stone that weighed 52 grams. She had found the healing ritual in an old lapidary of her fathers, but actually casting the ritual was recommended only for masters. That was why she needed such a large stone. If her unchannelled power overflowed into her mother- Well. It would make the disease that wracked her body look like a mercy.

Even if the shops had had a stone of appropriate size, Miranda knew she would need a guild signed order to purchase it. Sunstone was among the rarest stones used for channelling magic. Wanting to buy a rare stone wasn’t a crime. But healing her mother, an Idum, was. Society had labelled her mother as worthless – unable to use magic, her life didn't deserve to be saved by stone.

Miranda knew that time was running out. Every second she delayed, every minute she couldn’t find the stone she needed, her mother grew weaker.
And so she had ended up in the poorest part of the city. The people who ran shops here were desperate at best and thieves more often than not, but she had nowhere else to turn. She pushed open the faded door. It creaked and caught on the uneven lintel. A shaft of sunlight entered the shop behind her, shining golden on the slate floors and lighting up the swirling dust motes that she’d disturbed. There was no tinkling bell. 

The stoppered glass jars on display contained dried herbs alongside crushed rocks, as if they too could channel power. A fire burned in the grate, and a candle flickered on the front counter.

The sound of a throat clearing drew her attention to a desk crammed in the corner. Piles of teetering parchment covered the surface, and an old man leaned around one side. He had a large, crooked nose, and an angry scar cut across one craggy eyebrow. His eyes flicked to the bulging coin purse in her hand and to the gleaming topaz cloak clasp she wore, before they met hers. “Can I help you Miss?” He smiled, but she had already failed his test. The smile didn’t reach his eyes.

Miranda stepped forward anyway, fingers tightly clenched around her purse. “I hope so,” Her voice scratched. “I’m looking for sunstone.”

He raised his eyebrows and his face shimmered for a moment before he spoke slowly. “I see. I have some powdered, but that won’t help you, will it?” His eyes trailed over her unkempt hair, her red rimmed eyes, and the desperate grip that she had on both her purse and her emotions.

Miranda shook her head, even though she could see he already knew the answer. “I’m looking for a large stone.” She sized it roughly with her hands.

He laughed, but it wasn’t a joyful sound. “There’s been no sunstones that size since the ritual.”

Feeling her last chance slipping away, she hurried closer to him, grasping for any lie that might convince him. “Anything you have– It’s for the guild. An approved study-”

He slammed a hand onto the desk, nostrils flaring. “They’d better harvest them themselves then!”

She drew back, eyes darting to where the door had closed behind her. He had not been friendly, and his face was not pretty, but Miranda had felt reassured by his clean hands, and his neatly mended tunic. This was the first time she felt frightened. A log shifted in the grate and the flames pulled inwards.

The shop-keeper closed his eyes, and breathed out, low and slow. “You are in no danger from me.” His eyes remained closed though, and his breathing controlled. “You are not the guild. And there are no stones to be had, no matter the study you are doing.”

Miranda looked again to the door. He seemed to have regained control, but– She reached down into the slate beneath her feet, grasping desperately for the calm power that she knew rested there. “Please.” Her voice broke, the magic slipped out of reach. “My father is the one running the study. I’m sure he would remember if you were to provide it.” It was a desperate play. Her father would offer no favours in return for a stone he had refused to search for. He had refused to heal her mother, and insisted that Miranda do the same.

The reply came slowly. Miranda’s hands began to sweat. “And who's your father?” 

She fiddled with the cuff of her cloak. She shouldn't have mentioned her father– it would only make her more identifiable, make her more easily caught. But it would do no good to back down now. And if the shop-keeper were enquiring, then perhaps he did have a suitable gem.  “The Sorcerer of Rutledge.”

The man's fingers tightened on the edge of the desk, though from fear or anger she could not tell. Her father was high up in the Sorcerer's Circle, and all the more hated for it in places like these.

He spoke again. “A sunstone to be used for study, not for healing?” He peered into her eyes as though divining the truth, and the candles on his desk flickered in an invisible breeze.

The man nodded sharply, muttering to himself. “Very well. Very well. The Lord Rutledge for a study.” He looked back at her directly.  “And no one else will use it?” Before she could begin to formulate a lie, he looked away again, answering his own question. “No, no, of course not. He wouldn’t want the guild to know he was dabbling.” He rustled in his desk drawer, talking all the while. “I have a stone that may meet your requirements,” Finally he pulled out a small brass key and led her to a large locked cabinet. The doors were bevelled antiques, but rather than gleaming they were covered in grime. He unlocked them and withdrew a velvet pouch. One more hesitation, as though weighing the stone in his hand. Weighing up the gold in her purse against the penalty she thought cynically. After all, the punishment for selling an unregistered stone was worse even than the punishment for buying one.

He turned back to the desk and tipped the stone onto its cluttered surface.

She leaned forward, desperate to see the gem that she hoped would save her mother. Her heart fell. It was a large stone, two crystals growing together, slightly asymmetrically. But it was a clear turquoise, not the translucent orange that she had been expecting.

She reached out one hand, resting a finger lightly on the surface. It was warm. She drew her hand away again, surprised. “The colour–” she began.

He stared at her cooly offering nothing.

“I– I thought sunstones were–”

“A plagioclase feldspar mineral with copper or hematite inclusions, causing a distinct oily shimmer on the surface?” He tilted the stone from side to side, and sure enough Miranda could see a sunset shimmer overlaying the cool aquamarine. He raised one shaggy eyebrow. “Do you even have an apprentice token, or are you just a carrier pigeon?”

Miranda flushed. She did have an apprentice token, but it was tucked into her father’s desk. It was to be hers, one day. But he hadn’t given it to her yet. Normally it was a source of shame – apprentices were ordinarily chosen at 18, not 20. Today it was irrelevant.

She thrust her chin forward. “How much for the stone?” 

He grimaced, “There’s no way you have what this stone is really worth.”

Miranda was silent. He was probably right. Anyone with a sick relative would pay anything they had for a chance like this. She offered the purse regardless. 
He took it and weighed it in his hand. Then he nodded. “I’ll take it, but take a message with that stone. Tell your father that his study won’t help him to master magic that doesn’t belong to his people.”

Miranda blinked. She had no idea what he was referring to, or why the man thought her father wouldn’t be able to study a healing ritual using one of the most powerful stones in Alegra. Afterall, her father was one of the Land’s most powerful mages. 

Realising she had been silent too long, Miranda nodded quickly. She exchanged her coin purse for his velvet pouch, and barely spared a thought for the true meaning of the message, or how she would deliver it. Instead she hurried home, filled with hope for her family, her hand wrapped tightly around the pulsing, warmth of the stone.
