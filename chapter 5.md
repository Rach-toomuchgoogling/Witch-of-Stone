Miranda woke to the sound cart wheels rumbling on the nearby path. Her body complained as she rolled over. She had walked for miles yesterday, further than she ever had before. And her muscles were informing her in no uncertain terms that they did not want to do it again. Her arms ached as she pushed back the covers. Her legs burned as she stood. She raised her arms above her head, trying to ease the stiffness. But instead of relief, her back muscles joined in the chorus of complaints. 

Many of the people who had camped at the fork in the road had already risen. Bed rolls had been packed, and breakfast cooked over embers. The family she had stayed near last night were loading the last of their things back onto the donkey.

They looked tired, but cheerful. Not one of them was moving stiffly. Even the toddler seemed ready for another day of travel.

Johnny noticed her rising, and smiled at her, but he didn't come over. The family had been kind to her, and had offered further help if she continued with them to the forest, but Miranda waved Johnny and his family on. She had to decide which fork to take herself.

She moved slowly as she packed up her bedroll. She fumbled with the string to tie it; clumsy, but also dreading the decisions she would have to make soon. She repacked her provisions twice. And she made sure her water skin was completely full. 

Once she was packed, Miranda stood staring at the fork for a long time. The wind tugged hair out of her loose braid and dried her lips. When she licked ,the cracks from yesterday burned as the skin tightened. She had come on this quest with good reason, but the fact was, she had also come impulsively. She needed to know more about her choices before she walked into something she didn't understand.

There was no point delaying longer. She approached the stone hut slowly. The door was a silvered timber that was no longer fitted tightly to the frame. The stone itself was weathered, with small moss cushions growing on those stones closest to the ground.  The hut fitted into the landscape. 

Miranda had seen plenty of travellers speak to the old woman inside on their way through, but that didn't prevent her nerves. "Hello?" She called.

The door swung loosely on its hinges. The woman who lived in the hut was older than Miranda had thought. She stood in the doorway, bracing herself with one hand on the frame. Her face was more wrinkle than smile, and her hair thin and grey. 

But her eyes were clear as she looked at Miranda. "You camped last night?" The woman paused for a moment, then continued. "Come inside."

She turned and shuffled slowly into the hut without waiting for Miranda to reply.

Miranda hadn't seen a single other person enter...but she wanted information, and she had no one else to ask. Slowly she followed the woman through the darkened doorway. As soon as she crossed the threshold she felt the stone hum softly. It surrounded her with warmth, and with power. 

It took a few minutes for her eyes to adjust to the dim lighting. The hut was a single room. The furniture was simple. There were a few chests for storage against the walls, and a single shelf contained scrolls and books. A fire was burning in the grate despite the heat of the day, but the woman didn't seem to notice the sweat that beaded on Miranda’s forehead. "You camped here for safety last night, but you didn't pay the toll."

"The toll?" Miranda stopped, halfway into the room.

"Here at the fork there’s nothing to eat anymore.” The woman waved one gnarled hand towards the doorway, as though to encompass the barren land that surrounded them. “Nobody lives here except the stone guards, and me. People who travel the road bring offerings- food, or coin, so that I can stay here, and so that the fork remains safe." She smiled, not unkindly, before continuing. "So that I can provide information."

"Oh."

“It’s a … toll?” Miranda felt the unfamiliar word roll around her mouth. She hovered her hand uncertainly over her rucksack- she didn't have much she could offer. And she had even less to spare But she could still feel the power in the walls of the hut, and she could feel the quietly coiled power in this woman too. There was a reason people camped here. A reason that they trusted this woman, and brought her supplies.

Miranda pulled out her remaining apple. Its skin was duller than when she had packed it. There was a soft dent on one edge that would likely have bruised flesh beneath. It looked small and sad when placed in the centre of the table. 

Her hand brushed against her bag of nuts and seeds, and swallowing, she pulled them out too. "I'm sorry" Miranda said finally, resting the bag on the table. "This is all I have, and I can’t offer it all."

The old woman sighed, and Miranda felt a pulse through the walls, and into her soul, as though she's being tested for truthfulness. She had grown up around stone magic, and her father was a powerful and respected mage. But she had never felt anything like this before.

"You think you speak the truth," The woman said softly, "but there is much about yourself and our world that you are yet to learn. The toll is voluntary, you have no need to apologise. And for your honesty and willing sacrifice I will give you some advice." She bypassed the table completely, and lowered herself slowly into a chair by the fire.

"Since the stone mages twisted the balance, and put themselves in power, the desert has been wild and heartless. It's a shorter road, but a dangerous one. Alegra won't answer you there, no matter how large the stones you find."

Miranda swallowed. “What do you mean?” Alegra had answered her since before she could remember. Her magic might be untrained, and not particularly strong. But she had been taught to connect to the land very young, and Alegra had always answered, offering comfort at the very least. “Why won’t she answer? Like she’s angry?” Her voice sounded small in the room– like a child.

“Noone knows if she cannot hear us, or if she simply refuses to answer. A great wrong was done there to many people. But it is not only stone mages that can’t find her.”

The idea of losing her power was not a pleasant one. "And the other road? If I go left will Alegra be… "

"The forest road is welcoming for most.” The woman interrupted. “It won't be easy, but your magic will answer you." The woman paused for so long that Miranda began to wonder if she’d fallen asleep.

“So I should take that one then.” Miranda said almost to herself. She looked around the hut again, this time noticing a hand drawn map hung across one wall. “How long have you been here for?”

The woman looked at her for a long time, before ignoring her question completely. "Do you have a Stone of Power?"

Miranda shook her head. The closest she had was her Topaz clasp, but they were small chips, and only for show.

"Take your food from the table, and take one stone from the chest at the end of my bed," the woman said, closing her eyes in clear dismissal. "Good luck on your quest, child of Alegra."

Miranda rose slowly. She looked at the food on the table, and quickly stuffed the bag back into her rucksack. She looked around again at the simple furnishings, and at the woman’s thin wrists, and gnarled hands.

She left the apple on the table, and moved to the trunk at the end of the bed. It was beautiful in its simplicity. A dark timber that had been smoothed until it looked soft. It had no carving or embellishment, but it didn’t need any enhancement beyond the grain of the wood.

Miranda glanced back at the woman, as though expecting to be stopped. When no objection came, she opened the lid of the trunk, and carefully shifted the clothes inside aside. Eventually she found a collection of glimmering gems wrapped in a soft woolen shawl. She took a moment to decide. For a moment she hoped that one would warm to her, or that there would be some sign.

But when nothing happened, and nothing changed, she picked up a deep green stone that fit nicely in her hand, and slipped it into her pocket.

She hesitated for a long moment. There were still half a dozen other stones nestled int the fold in the shawl. Should she take another? The old woman surely wouldn’t notice til she'd gone… But where outside Alegra had felt far away, in the hut her magic was singing. Of course she wouldn't steal. Magic is about balance, about respect. 

She closed the lid gently, and turned to leave, missing the soft smile that the old woman gave from her chair near the fire.
