# Chapter 3

Miranda was not giving up. She tied the velvet pouch holding her sunstone around her waist, and slung her rucksack over one shoulder. Her parents might be sitting around waiting for her Mother to die, but she was going to find a way to make her better.

If other magics were real, and had the power to heal, then all Miranda had to do was find them. And she knew exactly where to start. Steven had known all along about the other magics. When she was at his shop she had scoffed at him selling herbs and powders as though they contained real power. But he had been right all along. She was sure that he would be able to direct her to other mages. 

If he didn’t murder her of course.

She hurried from her room, tip-toing down the stairs so that her parents didn’t hear. She could hear them conversing in low murmurs from their room. 

Her mother had sounded certain that no other mage would ever work with a stone mage again. And that may be true. But even if no one else would help her, Miranda had thought of something else. Steven had yelled something, in his anger, “If you want a sunstone, you can harvest them yourselves.”

Miranda had never thought about where the stones of power came from. And she’d never wondered why they were becoming more and more expensive. It sounded as though the other mages were refusing to mine them out of resentment and anger.

Fair enough, Miranda could acknowledge. She’d be furious if someone twisted her magic. But she wasn’t like the other stone mages. She wanted a true sunstone, and she was willing to work for it. Steven could tell her where she could harvest it herself. 

Soon enough she found herself back in the dingy alleys of Singemont. Her cause was no less desperate this time; her mother’s life still hung in the balance. But her focus was less absolute. 

She watched a few children playing knucklebones in the street. Were they idum? Did they have magic they were forbidden from using? They laughed and played, and complained when they lost. They looked just like anybody else, except for the poverty surrounding them.

She half hoped to see some surreptitious magic use- a flower blooming out of season. A bucket filling itself with water. As though knowing now that other magics existed would open her eyes to a new world, a new community. But there was nothing.

The eyes of the men and women gathered at the fountain were as unfriendly as ever. She watched for longer than was polite, blushing and looking away when one of the women stared grimly back at her.

She headed for Steven’s shop, taking care not to stumble on the cobblestones and to step over and around the refuse littering the alley. There was still no bell as she pushed open the damaged door. 

The space was no more welcoming a second time. And Steven, when he looked up from the powders he was pouring at the desk, didn’t look pleased to see her.

“You again.”

Miranda nodded absently. She was in no hurry to speak this time. Instead she gazed around the store. Taking the time to observe what she hadn’t before. The jars of herbs she had taken for superstition, the candles and fireplace, even the silver mirror above a bowl of water- these were all small acts of rebellion. Little nods towards a broader magic, and an absolute refusal to acknowledge stone’s current dominance.

Finally she met Steven’s eyes. She took her time to study him as well. He wasn’t as old as she had thought. Only a few years older than her father. But he had the lean look of someone who worked hard for what they had. 

She opened her mouth to ask about where to find a true sunstone, but seeing the the scar on his cheek, found that she couldn’t begin. It stood out brighter, now that she could imagine what he was fighting for when he received it.

“I’m sorry about your son.” She winced at the look on his face.  “It’s none of my-”

“No, it isn’t. Why are you back, stone witch? Was your father not happy with the stone I sent him.” His face said that he was delighted with her father’s displeasure.

Miranda hesitated. She had forgotten she would have to tell him that she had lied to him the day before. “My mother is a plant witch”

His eyes darted to the door, as though he expected a guardsman to be lurking. “I know that she was.” His eyes didn’t soften.

She swallowed. Every time she spoke the words aloud it made them feel more real. “Did you know that she’s dying?”

It was his turn to hesitate. He glanced again at the door. There was no one else in the shop, and no one near the windows.

“Being of stone does not make you safe. You are a fool if you think so.” Finally he looked at her again. “I did not know your mother was unwell. Is that why your father wanted the stone?” 

He glanced back to his cupboard, and Miranda’s heart leapt. Was there a chance-

“I told you the truth when I said there were no such stones.”

It hurt every time her hopes were disappointed. “Could I find one?” She asked. “You said that the problem was the stone mages didn’t want to mine them for themselves. Could I?”
He looked at her for a long time and she shifted uncomfortably. Her eyes shot to the candle on the bench as it flamed suddenly.

“Why isn’t your father here?” He asked suddenly. “You were looking for the stone for yourself” He sneered. “He won’t risk his precious position even for his wife’s life?”

“No. That’s not-” Miranda frowned. Both her mother and father had forbidden her from continuing to search for a stone to help. Both of them had been horrified at what she was going to attempt. But it was her mother who had refused her father’s help. And it was because she didn’t want to risk the consequences to Miranda. “Mum won’t let him. She said the Stone Guards have come after whole families before.”

He looked at her for a long time. “How old are you, Miranda?”

“18. What does that matter?”

“Your mother must have been pregnant when the balance was twisted. I had wondered…” He ran a hand through his greying hair. It must have been a common action- his hair was already in disarray. “What have you come here for? I don’t have a stone. And your parents are right that it’s incredibly dangerous.”

“You said the stone mages should mine the sunstones themselves.” She tried to hold his eyes. “I want to find a sunstone- I’ll mine it myself if I need to.”

He laughed. “Do you even know what that means? Have you ever been out of the city? No?” He shook his head in disbelief. “Stones of power are found all through the Land of Alegra, many in places where stone mages are no longer welcome. Do you really want to head into the heart of a volcano?”

“Er.” Miranda wasn’t sure if he was joking. “Inside a volcano?”

“Sunstones and jade are from Fire mage territory. Diamonds and pearls come from the water mages. Jasper and Opals are from the Air cliffs.”

Miranda stared, entranced. “And the plant mages?”

“They make living stone.” He said smiling, as though he knew something that she didn’t. “Or they did, before the central desert formed.”

“So I need to go to the fire mages.” Miranda’s eyes flicked toward the candle whose flame flickered seemingly in response to Steven’s rage. She looked back at him to see him already shaking his head. “You’re a fire-”

“I’m an Idum,” He interrupted her bluntly. “I’ve no power to speak of, and no people left either. I can’t stop you from heading North, but I’ll give you a warning for the memory of my son. The fire mages won’t want you there. They won’t welcome you, and they won’t help you. If you’re lucky, they won’t hurt you.” He sighed softly. “Go home and hug your mother while you still can. Even the plant mages wouldn’t be able to do more than delay the end with the balance twisted.”

A young man her age banged the door open, walking in as though he owned the place. Steven tensed immediately as he entered. The lad was her age. He didn’t look like a stone guard. His red hair was spiked, his tunic ruffled, and most importantly, he was smiling as he rummaged through a cupboard.  He was not a risk as far as Miranda could see. But when she opened her mouth Steven shook his head hard in response and turned away.

Seeing that she would get no further answers from him, Miranda left the shop, thoughtful. 

She was not going home.
