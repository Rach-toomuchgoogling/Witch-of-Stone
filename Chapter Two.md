# Chapter 2

The leather cover cracked loudly as Miranda opened the lapidary, but her mother didn’t stir. Instead she lay still on the bed, one hand resting limply on the covers as though it were waiting to be held.  Miranda didn’t hold it.

Magic was the only way to help her mother now. The spine of the book was stiff, and the pages were loose. She didn’t know how old it was, but a whole section had been lost, either to time, or an angry hand.
But the ritual she needed had been saved. Most magic used the power of the land; mages drew on Alegra’s natural magic and channelled it through stone to enhance their control. The older a stone, the more times it was used, the closer it’s connection to Alegra, and the smoother the passage of magic. 
This powerful healing ritual was different. If done correctly, it would consume the sunstone. Incorrectly, and the cost would fall on her mother and on herself.

She ran one finger lightly down the yellowed page. The spidery writing was hard to follow. A large portion of the page was dedicated to warnings- reiterations that the ritual was not to be undertaken unless all other choices had been exhausted. Miranda looked again at her mother’s pale face. There were no other choices.

<i>Liberal amounts of rosemary- fresh

3 beeswax candles

A silver bowl of purified water

Perform the ritual outdoors, facing the cliffs</i>

There was rosemary in the kitchen, she was sure. And a candle of some sort in the drawer. Surely her mother’s glass of water would suffice, rather than a silver bowl? The lapidary was old, and no doubt old fashioned. Modern mages knew that the quality of the stone was the only thing that really mattered!
Miranda fingered the velvet pouch and then, in a sudden movement, tipped the sparkling stone into her right hand. Funny– it had felt warm in the store, and for the walk home. Now it was cool on her palm. She closed her eyes, and reached inwards, feeling the centre of the stone. She yanked her magic back, burnt. If the stone had felt cool on her palm, then it was just a warning for the ice waiting within. 
She pulled her coak more firmly around herself, and reached over the bed for her mother’s hand. A deep breath to brace herself– .

“How was your– Miranda! What are you doing!” Her father’s voice rose in volume as he entered the room, and her mother shifted slightly on the bed from the noise. 

Miranda whirled around to face him, fumbling to hide the stone in the folds of her cloak. Her Dad  wasn’t due home for another hour. She watched his eyes move from her face, to her clutching hand, and then land on the lapidary. His eyes darkened, and he crossed the room in two quick steps to grasp her hand.
“You’re hurting me.” Miranda’s voice sounded small in the room.

Her Father didn’t respond; one hand stayed tight around her wrist. The other forced her hand open, and exposed the sunstone. He recoiled as though burnt. “Where did you get that?”

Miranda blinked silently. She had known, of course, that her father would be angry if she used stone magic on her mother. But she hadn’t expected the terrible fear in his eyes, or the angry red mark around her wrist.
“From Singemont,” she said, rubbing her wrist lightly. “I went to the ingredient store on the corner.”

“Steven sold you that?” He kept his voice even, but she could see the control it took in his tense shoulders and flaring nostrils. “Well? Did he sell it to you?”

Miranda shrugged, mouth dry. She didn’t know the name of the shopkeeper at the store.

Her father ran a hand through his hair. “You bought a sunstone aquamarine, and didn’t even know the name of the seller.” He laughed, though no one was joking. “Steven,” He trailed a finger down his cheek. “Great big scar, blames the guild for his son dying… ring any bells?”

“I-.” Miranda swallowed and tried again. “I didn’t know his son died. That’s awful. How–”

Her dad lowered his eyes to the floor and shook his head regretfully. “It was awful. The guild couldn’t have known what would happen. That’s no reason to try to kill my wife and child though.” Miranda could feel the power thrumming round him in silent threat. “I think we need to have a … chat.”
Her Dad closed the lapidary and tucked it under his arm before heading for the door.

She opened her mouth. And closed it. There was more going on here than she had realised. But Steven had tried to help her, not kill her. She had known the ritual was dangerous before she went shopping for a sunstone. “Wait, Dad. He didn’t try to kill me. I found the ritual. I went to him for the stone.”

Her father’s steps faltered, then stopped altogether.. He spoke slowly, without tuning around. “You asked for that stone? A sunstone aquamarine?”

Miranda looked at the stone, still loose on her palm. “I asked for a sunstone. I–” She blushed. “I thought they were orange, but he– Steven said this was a sunstone. Because of the shimmer.” She tilted it weakly in his direction, showing the subtle play of light on the surface. 

He sighed, and returned to stand beside her. “It is a sunstone, but not the one you wanted. A sunstone aquamarine is a powerful healing stone. But if you used it for the ritual I think you were about to try, it would have killed you and your mother.”

Miranda blinked back tears. “I know you don’t think I’m good enough, but–”

“Silly girl.” It was said softly, lifting her wrist, and running his fingers lightly over the fading the red mark. “This isn’t about you being good enough. This is about me not teaching you, and that conniving singe-er giving you the wrong stone.” He sighed, seeing that Miranda still didn’t understand.

He sat himself on the side of the bed, careful not to disturb her Mother. He settled the book onto his lap, and patted it gently. “I should have destroyed this book, really. But my mother gave it me, and her father before that. So instead I tore out some pages. Did you not wonder why so much of the text was missing?” He flicked to the missing section.
Miranda shrugged. She had wondered, a little. But mostly she had been concerned about her Mum, and running out of time. Even now she was wondering where she should go, what to try to get a real sunstone.

Her father looked into her eyes, face serious. “This has been struck from our history, Miranda. It’s not spoken about. If you can’t keep the secret, if you kick up a fuss, you’ll be labelled an Idum, just as your mother was.”

Miranda looked up sharply, her focus drawn back to the conversation. “An Idum? They could take my magic away?”  She hugged herself as though to ward off a chill.

“That’s the question, isn’t it? Can the guild take away anyone’s magic? No. Last time they tried, Steven’s son died.” He sighed heavily. “But they can and have refused the balance. And polite society would cast you down and out.” He reached out behind himself to take her mother’s hand. “Steven forgets that we all lost something when the balance was broken. That we all made compromises.”

Miranda grabbed onto the only part of the conversation that she really understood. “Steven’s son died because they tried to take his magic? But why? What did he do?” She remembered Steven’s message for her father. “Steven said– Er. I told him you wanted the stone to study.” She flushed, admitting to her lie. “And he said he would sell it to me if I delivered a message with it. That studying a stone like this wouldn’t grant you the magic of other people– is that what he meant? Did the guild try to take his Son’s magic for themselves?”

Her father looked unseeing around the room as he pondered Steven’s message. Finally he shook his head, and restarted the conversation.  “No, not exactly. I know the ritual you were planning to use.” He said, and rubbed small circles on her mothers’ hand with his thumb. “Why did you not follow the directions?”

Miranda frowned; what did he mean?

“You went to extraordinary lengths to fetch a rare stone,” he said, gesturing to the stone she still held. “Yet you didn’t fetch rosemary from the kitchen, or gather candles from the holders in the lounge. Why not?”

“It’s an old book, Dad, we know better now. The magic comes to us from the Land of Alegra, and stone is the conduit. Mum doesn’t have much time, I didn’t need to faff around with old wives tales and superstition.” She rolled her eyes with a laugh, “I mean, a silver bowl filled with water.” she rolled her eyes. “You taught me better than that.” 
Her grin faded as she took in the frown lines carved into his forehead.

“You’re a little fool.” He said harshly. “But you’re right- I didn’t teach you any better than that.” The harshness was directed at himself. “If I had come home just a little later it would have been to two bodies, all because I kept the guild secrets.” He eyed the turquoise coloured stone again, and shook his head. “Without the balance of plants and water, air and flame, the ritual would have failed, even with the right stone.” 
“True sunstone is precious, and consumed, because it allows a stone mage to perform healing magic alone, with only lip service to the balance.” He gestured to the list of extra ingredients in the lapidary. “That stone,” he paused and folded her fingers closed over the sunstone in her hand, “Will help us to channel magic from the land of Allegra into healing. But it requires the control of 5 mages. One stone, one plant, one water, one air and one fire.”

That’s not right, Miranda thought. She shook her head. “Stone magic is the only magic!” she argued. She had been told that from the time she was incredibly small.

“No. Stone magic is the only allowed magic.”

“But. But, why?”

“Because the stone mages wanted to be in charge.” Her mother’s voice was bitter.

Her father opened and closed his mouth as though he wanted to refute her statement, but couldn’t.

“Working with another mage meant opening your magic to each other. It was, magical, and intimate.” Miranda’s mother’s eyes fluttered closed. “We just hadn’t realised it made us vulnerable to each other too. But the stone mages saw it, and they took advantage.”

Miranda looked at her mother’s pained face. “Were you there?” 

“We both were.” Her father answered for her. “It was a major blessing ritual- held at the stone circle. The stone mages planned to pull the power balance towards themselves; make themselves the strongest.”

“Not all the stone mages.” Her mother reached a comforting hand to her father.

“No, but enough of us to twist the balance.” he replied darkly. “They didn’t know what they were doing,” he explained to Miranda. “They couldn’t pull magic out of the other mages- we all channel magic from the Land of Alegra.” 

She nodded slowly. “So what happened?”

“They pulled the connections instead, dragged them to centre on stone, instead of being equally shared. It strained the connections of the mages with Alegra, and shrank their magic. And the connections between them snapped.” 

“Can it be undone?” Surely someone would want to put this right.

“Many of the stone mages don’t want to put it right. They’re more powerful now after-all. To put it right would take another ritual, equal in size to the first. But this time, instead of connecting to everyone equally, they would all have to connect through stone.”

“We should do that then!” Miranda looked at the stone in her hand, already imagining a balanced ritual healing her mother.

“The other mages will never connect to stone again.” her mother said finally.

“Wha-?”
“The stone mages are more powerful now,” her Dad explained. “If they pulled a second time, in a large ritual, or even a small one, they might snap the connection with Alegra entirely.”

“But you said they can’t take my magic!” Miranda exclaimed.

Her Dad hesitated a moment. “That’s what happened to Steven’s son. He trusted a stone mage, and when they betrayed him, and pulled, he died.”

“We will never connect again.” her mother said softly. “Besides, being caught practising other magics, even on your own, is a death sentence for your whole family these days.” She looked longingly at the forest painting on the wall. “It’s been a long time since I’ve felt Alegra.”

Miranda stared at her mother, thoughts pinging around her brain so fast she could see what was coming. But it was something big, something– “If you’re a mage, you can do magic on yourself! We don’t need the right stone, or–”

Her mother was already shaking her head. “I wouldn’t be strong enough to heal myself alone,” she said.

“But you could try! And Dad could help you! You trust him!” 

“I trust your father of course.” Rose spoke slowly. “But I don’t do magic anymore. We agreed years ago that we would follow the stone laws. The risks are too great, and our family’s safety comes first. That hasn’t changed.”

“But Rose–”

“No James.” Her face was hard. “You will respect my wishes in this. And Miranda will be safe.”

“But you’ll be dead!” Miranda’s eyes burned. “If you would just try!” 

“We all die.” 

Miranda turned from her mother’s pale face, to see her father’s grieving one. He bowed his head in defeat.
